# linearregression_bitcoin
This repo contains google colab code on linear regression that  I completed during my masters in data science  course at kingston university  
The simplest vanilla model of linear regression was implemented on predicting the "  MARKET PRICE OF BITCOIN" based upon 24 features that influence its price.
